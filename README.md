# [Discontinued] LAN Cache in a docker container

***
A Quick note. This project is being Discontinued and reopened at a later time as a new project source. The reason for this is because I want to start from scratch and not have to worry about this as much. The OpenSourceLAN guys already pulled my changes and have updated it a bit more than me, go check their project if you would like to keep using it. I will be creating a more AIO focused project in the future as I get time.

Simply expose this container on port 80, and point a bunch of domains to this server's IP address, 
and you get a fully operational LAN cache. Hooray!

To build and run, do:
```
./buildcontainer.sh
./start.sh
```

`start.sh` will make a /data/ directory to store logs and cache data in. 

*Warning*: some services (eg, when downloading the Origin client) require HTTPS access to the 
hosts that we are hijacking. To avoid connectivity issues, you will need to run an 
[SNI proxy](https://github.com/dlundquist/sniproxy) to enable pass through of HTTPS traffic. 

You can build and run the sniproxy container in the `sniproxy` directory to achieve this. 

```
cd sniproxy
docker build -t sniproxy .
docker run --name sniproxy -p 443:443 sniproxy
```
